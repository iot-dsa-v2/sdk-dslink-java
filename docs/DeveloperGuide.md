# DSLink Java Developer Guide

[Home](https://github.com/iot-dsa-v2/sdk-dslink-java) â€¢ [Javadoc](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/)

## Warning

Only use org.iot.dsa APIs, do not use or depend on anything in the com.* packages.  

Please utilize the 
[Javadoc](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/)
for the core sdk.  It's not perfect, but the more it is referenced, the better it will get.

## Overview

The purpose of this document is to guide the reader through the development of Java DSA links using
this SDK. Developers will build links using the org.iot.dsa.* packages found in 
dslink-core sub-project.

Key objectives of this SDK:

  - Pluggable architecture:
    - Protocol independence.  Primarily to support DSA V1 and V2.
    - Transport independence.  Websockets, plain sockets, http, and whatever else comes along.
  - Support multiple Java links in the same process.
  - Support JDK 1.6 for Distech Controls.
  - High performance for activities such as video streaming.
  - Support very large configuration databases (100K+ points).
  - Support poll on demand whenever possible.
  - 3rd party library independence.  Some environments such as Niagara provide transport libraries 
    while others do not.  SLF4J and Netty were explicitly bound to the original SDK but can not be 
    used in Niagara because of it's very strict Security Manager.

## Creating a Link

These are the major steps you'll take when creating a link:

1. Create link boilerplate.
2. Create a main class.
3. Create a root node.
4. Create application nodes.

## Create Link Boilerplate

Copy the dslink-java-template subproject to create a new repository.  It's README provides
further instructions for customization.

## Create a Main Class

All this needs to do is create a link and run it as follows.

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        DSLinkConfig cfg = new DSLinkConfig(args);
        DSLink link = new DSLink(cfg);
        link.run();
    }
```

If using the boilerplate project, the main class must be specified in build.gradle.

    mainClassName = 'org.iot.dsa.dslink.template.Main'
    
In that project, the main class is also the root node.

## Create a Root Node

If you will be modeling data as a DSNode tree, then all you need to do is subclass 
[org.iot.dsa.dslink.DSRootNode](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/index.html?org/iot/dsa/dslink/DSRootNode.html).

Otherwise the root node must be subclass of 
[org.iot.dsa.node.DSNode](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/index.html?org/iot/dsa/node/DSNode.html).
and if your link is to be a responder, it must also implement 
[org.iot.dsa.dslink.DSResponder](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/index.html?org/iot/dsa/dslink/DSResponder.html).

The fully qualified class name must be specified as the **rootType** config in _dslink.json_.

If you want to proxy another model and don't need a persistent node tree, you should subclass 
DSNode and implement DSResponder interface.

You can also create a hybrid solution by subclassing DSRootNode, but implementing DSResponder in 
nodes lower in the tree.  If a node in a request path implements DSResponder, it is their
responsibility for processing the request.  Paths of the request will have the path leading to the
responder removed.  This approach can be used to get some configuration persistence without 
having to model everything as a DSNode or DSIValue.

## Create Application Nodes

The hook for link functionality is the node tree.  Links will subclass 
[org.iot.dsa.node.DSNode](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/index.html?org/iot/dsa/node/DSNode.html) 
and do the following:

1. Configure the default children (nodes, values and actions).
2. Use various lifecycle callbacks to trigger custom functionality.

### Constructors

DSNode sub-classes must support the public no-arg constructor.  This is how they will be 
instantiated when deserializing the configuration database.

### Defaults

Every subtype of DSNode has a private default instance, all other instances of any particular type 
are copies of the default instance.  This is why you should never perform application logic unless 
your node is running (started or stable).

If a DSNode subtype needs to have specific child nodes or values (most will), it should override
the declareDefaults method.  The method should:

1. Call super.declareDefaults();
2. Call DSNode.declareDefault(String name, DSIObject child) for each non-removable child.  Do not 
add dynamic children in declareDefaults, because if they are removed, they will be re-added the 
next time the link is restarted.

During node serialization (configuration database, not DSA interop), children that match their 
declared default are omitted.  This has two benefits:

1. Smaller node database means faster serialization / deserialization.
2. Default values can be modified in code and all existing databases will be automatically upgraded 
the next time the updated class loaded.

### Node Lifecycle

It is important to know the application lifecycle.  Your nodes should not execute any application
logic unless they are running (started or stable).

**Stopped**

A node is instantiated in the stopped state.  If a node tree has been persisted, it will be be fully
restored in the stopped state.  DSNode.onStopped will not be called, it is only called when nodes
transition from running to stopped.

When nodes are removed from a running parent node, they will be stopped.  DSNode.onStopped will be 
called after all child nodes have been stopped.

When a link is stopped, an attempt to stop the tree will be made, but it cannot be guaranteed.

**Started**

After the node tree is fully deserialized it will be started.  A nodes onStart method will be 
called after all of its child nodes have been started.  The only guarantee is that all child
nodes have been started.

Nodes will also started when they are added to an already running parent node.

**Stable**

Stable is called after the entire tree has been started.  The first time the node tree is loaded, 
there is a stable delay of 5 seconds.  This is configurable as **stableDelay** in _dslink.json_.

Nodes added to an already stable parent will have onStart and onStable called immediately.

When in doubt of whether to use onStarted or onStable, use onStable.

**Other Callbacks**

When a node is stable, there are several other callbacks for various state changes.  All callbacks
begin with **on** such as _onChildAdded()_.  See the 
[DSNode Javadoc](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/index.html?org/iot/dsa/node/DSNode.html) 
for a complete list.

### Subscriptions

Nodes should suspend, or minimize activity when nothing is interested in them.  For example, if 
nothing is interested in a point, it is best to not poll the point on the foreign system.  

To do this you use the following APIs:

* DSNode.onSubscribed - Called when the node transitions from unsubscribed to subscribed.  This is
not called for subsequent subscribers once in the subscribed state.
* DSNode.onUnsubscribed - Called when the node transitions from subscribed to unsubscribed.   If
there are multiple subscribers, this is only called when the last one unsubscribes.
* DSNode.isSubscribed - Tells the caller whether or not the node is subscribed.

### Values

Values mostly represent leaf members of the node tree.  There are two types of values:

1. [org.io.dsa.node.DSElement](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/index.html?org/iot/dsa/node/DSElement.html) - 
These map to the JSON type system and represent leaf members of the node tree.
2. [org.io.dsa.node.DSIValue](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/index.html?org/iot/dsa/node/DSIValue.html) - 
These don't map to the JSON type system, and it is possible for nodes to implement this 
interface.  This allows for values with children.

The node model encourages values to be immutable and singletons.  This is for efficiency, the same 
value instance (e.g. DSBoolean.TRUE) can be stored in many nodes.

Whenever possible, values should also have NULL instance.  Rather than storing a generic null, 
this helps the system decode the proper type such as when a requester is attempting to set
a value.
  
### Actions

Actions allow allow responders to expose functionality that can't be modeled as values.

Add actions to your node using 
[org.iot.dsa.node.action.DSAction](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/index.html?org/iot/dsa/node/action/DSAction.html).  

Override DSNode.onInvoke to handle invocations.

```java
    private DSInfo doSomething = getInfo("Do Something");

    @Override
    protected void declareDefaults() {
        DSAction action = new DSAction();
        action.addParameter("Arg", DSString.valueOf("arg"), "A description");
        declareDefault("Do Something", action);
    }
    
    private void doSomething(String arg) {}

    @Override
    public ActionResult onInvoke(DSInfo actionInfo, ActionInvocation invocation) {
        if (actionInfo == doSomething) {
            DSElement arg = invocation.getParameters().get("Arg");
            doSomething(arg.toString());
            return null;
        }
        return super.onInvoke(actionInfo, invocation);
    }
```

### DSInfo

All node children have corresponding DSInfo instances.  This type serves serves two purposes:

1. It carries some meta-data about the relationship between the parent node and the child.
2. It tracks whether or not the child matches a declared default.

Important things for developers to know about DSInfo are:

* You can configure state such as transient, readonly and hidden.
* You can declare fields in the your Java class for default info instances to avoid
looking up the child every time it is needed.  This is can be used to create fast getters and 
setters.

Without declaring fields (lookups required):

```java
    public void declareDefaults() {
        super.declareDefaults();
        declareDefault("The Int", DSInt.valueOf(0));
    }
    public int getTheInt() {
        DSInt theInt = (DSInt) get("The Int"); //map lookup
        return theInt.toInt();
    }
    public void setTheInt(int value) {
        put("The Int", DSInt.valueOf(value)); //map lookup
    }
```

With declared fields:

```java
    private DSInfo theInt = getInfo("The Int"); //will be null in the default instance
    public void declareDefaults() {
        super.declareDefaults();
        declareDefault("The Int", DSInt.valueOf(0));
    }
    public int getTheInt() {
        return theInt.toInt(); //no lookup
    }
    public void setTheInt(int value) {
        put(theInt, DSInt.valueOf(value)); //no lookup
    }
```

### Metadata

Metadata can be information such as units for number types and ranges for enums.

When the system collects metadata about an object, it uses these steps:

1. If the target value or node implements 
[org.iot.dsa.node.DSIMetadata](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/index.html?org/iot/dsa/node/DSIMetadata.html).
it will be given the opportunity to provide metadata first.
2. Then getMetadata on the parent node will be called with the DSInfo representing the child.
This will be useful when nodes want to store user editable metadata.

To simplify configuring metadata, use the utility class
[org.iot.dsa.node.DSMetadata](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/index.html?org/iot/dsa/node/DSMetadata.html).

## Timers and Threads

Use [org.iot.dsa.DSRuntime](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/index.html?org/iot/dsa/DSRuntime.html).

Create your own threads for long lived activities and try to make them daemon as well.

## Logging

Use Java Util Logging (JUL).  A high performance async logger is automatically installed as the
root logger and it also manages backups.  

Most types subclass 
[org.iot.dsa.logging.DSLogger](https://iot-dsa-v2.github.io/sdk-dslink-java/javadoc/index.html?org/iot/dsa/logging/DSLogger.html) 
as a convenience.

<b>Level Guidelines</b>

- finest = verbose or trace
- finer  = debug
- fine   = minor and/or frequent event
- config = configuration info
- info   = major and infrequent event
- warn   = unusual and infrequent, not critical
- severe = critical / fatal error or event
