## Overview

This repository contains a Java SDK for creating [DSA](http://iot-dsa.org) links. to learn about 
the DSA architecture, please visit 
[this description of how DSA works](http://iot-dsa.org/get-started/how-dsa-works).

## Sub Projects

  - **/dslink-v2** - The APIs used to build new links.
  - **/dslink-v2-poc** - For proof of concept and testing.
  - **/dslink-v2-websocket** - Used by links that run in their own process, rather
    than in an environment which provides another websocket implementation.
