## Overview

This project can be used to create the boilerplate for a new Java DSLink.  In a nutshell, copy it, 
change org.iot.dsa.dlink.template to your package structure and globally replace 
'dslink-java-template' with your link name.

If you are not familiar with DSA, an overview can be found at
[here](http://iot-dsa.org/get-started/how-dsa-works).

This link was built using the Java DSLink SDK which can be found
[here](https://github.com/iot-dsa-v2/sdk-dslink-java).
